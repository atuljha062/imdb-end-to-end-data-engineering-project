# imdb-end-to-end-data-engineering-project
In this project, we have developed a ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline hosted on AWS, leveraging data obtained through web scraping from the IMDB website. Our pipeline efficiently retrieves data from IMDB, applies necessary transformations to meet specific formatting requirements, and seamlessly loads it into a designated AWS data store.
